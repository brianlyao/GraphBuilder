# About GraphBuilder 0.1.6

GraphBuilder will be an open-source piece of software which allows users to visually construct [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) on a "editor" panel.

Currently, GraphBuilder is written in Java 9+. Please note that GraphBuilder is still in its very early stages!

# License

GraphBuilder is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. See LICENSE for details.

# Goals

Ultimately, users will be able to load and save their graphs, run algorithms on them, and export them as images. I also plan to port this to JavaScript one day to obviate the need for downloading an executable.

## External Dependencies

GraphBuilder fetches it dependencies using Maven. See pom.xml for details.
