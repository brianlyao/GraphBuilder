# GraphBuilder 0.0.2

GraphBuilder will be an open-source piece of software which allows users to visually construct [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) on a "editor" panel. Ultimately, users will be able to load and save their graphs, run algorithms on them, and export them as images.

Currently, GraphBuilder is written in Java 7 (built in Eclipse).

GraphBuilder is still in its early stages!
